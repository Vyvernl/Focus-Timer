# Focus Timer
- This project was created by Team 14 of the [Synthax](https://synthax.tech) hackathon at [Harvest International School](https://harvestinternationalschool.in)
- This was our 1st time making a chrome extension, so it isn't really good or based of a good idea.

## Challenges we ran into
- We couldn't figure out how to run the chrome extension in the background for our Previous Plan, hence we wasted hours of time.
- We weren't cooperating much because it was quite chaotic and stressful for us to fix this or find a solution hence we started goofing off and wasted a lot of time.

## Regrets
- Not preparing early (I asked them to join a cool but both of them ([Quiph](https://github.com/quiphster) and [Siddhansh](https://github.com/siddhansh123)) refused to join the call or had other things to do.)
- Wasting Time
- Using a free only trash web editor for our ad. (Should've used Davinci Resolve but had no time to install it)
